# ASTHG (An Sonic the Hedgehog Game)
This is an Sonic engine, made just for fun! (Idk if someone will use this)

It haves code parts from [Psych Engine](https://github.com/ShadowMario/FNF-PsychEngine/)... Sorry, I'm still learning on how to make my own code and I have ideas to replace them, but I don't know how to set it now.

Call me on Discord if you want to talk with me (@sunkydunky31)
