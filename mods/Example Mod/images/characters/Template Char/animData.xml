<animationData>

	<!--
		A little explanation of how this works
		Every node in `animationData` need to have this infos (? are optional):
		`name, id, ?fps, ?loopStart, ?rotate`
		
		name: Display name of the animation;
		id: Identifier, MUST MATCH IN JSON DATA, used the same for all characters, be careful!;
		fps: Velocity to play this animation, 0 becomes a static one
        I recommend you use RSDK Animation Editor to set this;
		loopStart: Where this animation should play again in loop after start
		rotated: This is used for rotating in stages, like loops, PAY ATTENTION AT THIS!

		rotated flags:
		0: No rotation;
		1: 45° rotated;
		2: 120° rotated;
		3: Full rotation (uses all ground angles);

		after `animation` node, you will create another one called `frame`
		it will be used in frame count for animations

		`frame` infos (? are optional)
		`x, y, width, height, ?centerX, ?centerY`

		x: Left corner position of this frame;
		y: Top corner position of this frame;
		width: Width of this frame;
		height: Height of this frame;
		centerX: X offset of this frame
		centerY: Y offset of this frame
