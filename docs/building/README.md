# Building

## Requirements
- Git: Used for installing `hxdiscord_rpc`, you can skip this step if you won't use 
discord rpc
- Haxe 4.3.2: OBRIGATORY, for compiling

## Setup
Windows:
 - Microsoft Visual Studio with Windows 10 SDK 19041
   - Use the batch file ("windows_setup-msvc") for easy setup
Start "windows_setup" to install all needed libraries and then,
Start the "windows_build" file (I recommend you to edit the settings in it)
